## VADET-Admin

This project is the user interace for administrators of Virtual Attributes, a research prototype to mine relational attributes out of visual data and its respective deep learning descriptors.

It is a client-server we application which requires pre-processed fiels as input (see GH prroject [preprocessing scripts](https://github.com/T-Gro/Visual-Attribute-Filtering-Scripts), and uses a relational database as its output. The database itself is not part of this project, but this project contains scripts which will create the schema from scratch via standard EntityFramework migrations.


## Install pre-requisites for developers

This page is written in F# and uses the SAFE template as its primary development stack.
You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* [FAKE 5](https://fake.build/) installed as a [global tool](https://fake.build/fake-gettingstarted.html#Install-FAKE)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager (you an also use `npm` but the usage of `yarn` is encouraged).
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.
* If you're running on OSX or Linux, you'll also need to install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

## Work with the application

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```
fake build -t Run
```


## SAFE Stack Documentation

You will find more documentation about the used F# components at the following places:

* [Saturn](https://saturnframework.org/docs/)
* [Fable](https://fable.io/docs/)
* [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/)
* [Fable.Remoting](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Fable.Remoting/)
* [Fulma](https://fulma.github.io/Fulma/)


## Troubleshooting

* **fake not found** - If you fail to execute `fake` from command line after installing it as a global tool, you might need to add it to your `PATH` manually: (e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"` on unix) - [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9321)
